# MonochromeDreamsClassification

Classifiers used for the Monochrome-Dreams Kaggle competition.

Models used (sorted alphabetically):
- Convolutional Neural Network
- K-nearest neighbors
- Support Vector Machine

I've provided a folder containing at least 10 evaluations - score results and graphs - of the different type of architechtures implemented for the CNN.

The documentation also contains approaches for the remaining two models and several mixed scores - unsatisfying and average.
